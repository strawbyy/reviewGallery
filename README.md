# Review Gallery

This project aims to *review* concepts I learn in C++. 

Note that often some methods will seem inefficient (they are), but that's simply because to achieve the purpose(s) of this project some inefficient methods will be used.

Purpose of this project:
- Get familiar with gitHub
- Review all concepts (and be all inclusive)

So far, most of my information comes from either Bucky's cpp tutorials or learncpp.com. Further down the line, I may use a book.

Thanks for checking this out.
