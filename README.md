# Review Gallery

This project aims to *review* concepts I learn in C++. 

Note that often some methods will seem inefficient (they are), but that's simply because to achieve the purpose(s) of this project some inefficient methods will be used.

Purpose of this project:
- Get familiar with gitHub
- Review all concepts (and be all **inclusive**)

So far, most of my information comes from either [Bucky's cpp tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvC1WCdV1XU&list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83)or www.learncpp.com. Further down the line, I will probably use a book.

Thanks for checking this out.
